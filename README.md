# Naive-work
learning the basic operation of python and some machine learning.

There are several steps to learn some programming skill:

1.code remotely (use git and github).Done.    

2.case1 coinmarketcap.The Internet worm. Done. 

3.case2 build a simple blockchain. Done.  

4.blockchain application.  
4.1 lightning network(light node).Done.  
4.2 lightning network(full node).

maybe some simple cases to familiar with usage.


...  
w.be familiar with ethereum  
w1.read the wiki and origin code.  
w2.try to build the ethereum blockchain.  


x.how to get data and clean data.

x+1.use some mathamatical model to handle them. (maybe machine learning)

x+2.get some visible result.

x+3.maybe basic blockchain usage.

Now we will build a lightening network full node.  
Perpas it has 8 steps, now I am in the step 4.2. I am trying to make the Raspberry Pi 3 communicate with my PC.

2019.02.14
Successfully build a simple blockchain, which can communicate with each other.  
But I failed to follow the longest chain, I don't know the reason. It is the lastest step, so I just put it down and move to the new project.

2019.02.10
Successfully update the code of case1-coinmarketcap. But I cannot open the website. So just waiting for the website.  
And I have set up the blue wallet, which is a lightning network wallet(light wallet).

The first class is how to use git to code remotely.  
I have learned the basic use of git & github.
