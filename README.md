learning the basic operation of python and some machine learning.

There are several steps to learn some programming skill:

1.code remotely (use git and github)

2.case1 coinmarketcap.The Internet worm.

3.blockchain application.
  3.1 lightning network(light node)
  3.2 lightning network(full node)

maybe some simple cases to familiar with usage.

...

x.how to get data and clean data.

x+1.use some mathamatical model to handle them. (maybe machine learning)

x+2.get some visible result.
